			<p>Oh, I think we should just stay friends. Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo! Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence.</p>
			<p>I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared… Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. Bender, we're trying our best. <a href="#">Guess again.</a> This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me!</p>
			<h2>Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose.</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Anyone who laughs is a communist!</li>
				<li>Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew.</li>
				<li>Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? <i>I don't 'need' to drink.</i> I can quit anytime I want! Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. Shinier than yours, meatbag.</p>

			<h1>It's okay, Bender.<a href="#post2" class="fas fa-hashtag"></a></h1>
			<p>Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped. All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school!</p>
			<p>And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you? Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets? <a href="#">Ask her how her day was.</a> That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing.</p>

			<h1>Really?!<a href="#post3" class="fas fa-hashtag"></a></h1>
			<p>This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. <i>That makes me feel angry!</i></p>
			<p>Yeah. Give a <a href="http://www.fillerama.io/" target="_blank">little credit</a> to our public schools. Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions? My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.</p>
			<h3>Hey, what kinda party is this?</h3>
			<p>Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig". Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'? Hello Morbo, how's the family?</p>
			<p>Can we have <a href="#">Bender Burgers</a> again? Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain. Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat.</p>
			<p><i>THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN!</i> She also liked to shut up! Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say.</p>
			<p>No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own! Hey, guess what you're accessories to. Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… <i>PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO</i>, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon.</p>
